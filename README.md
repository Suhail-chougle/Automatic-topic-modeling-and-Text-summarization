# Automatic-topic-modeling-and-Text-summarization
The project returns the potential topics and summary of the text or PDF entered by the user

The project takes in text or a PDF file from  the user and returns the potential topics with a 35% summary of the original text data.
To find the potential topics from a given text data we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
Summarization of the text uses a combination of Regex functions and Tf-idf vectorizer.
Tkinter is used for the GUI part of the project.
