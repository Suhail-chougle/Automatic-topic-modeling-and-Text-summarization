Project Title: Topic Extraction and Text Summarization Tool with Tkinter GUI

Introduction:
Welcome to my Topic Extraction and Text Summarization project! This tool allows users to input text or upload a PDF file and obtain potential topics extracted through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Additionally, it provides a concise 35% summary of the original text data using a combination of Regex functions and Tf-idf vectorizer. The graphical user interface (GUI) is developed using Tkinter, making it user-friendly and intuitive.

Project Overview:
This project revolves around two essential functionalities: topic extraction and text summarization. Users can enter or upload their text data, and the tool processes it to identify potential topics and generate a condensed summary.

Technologies Used:
- Python is the primary programming language for this project.
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is utilized for topic extraction, allowing the identification of underlying themes in the text data.
- Regex functions and Tf-idf vectorizer are employed to create a concise summary that captures the most important information from the original text.
- Tkinter is used to design and implement the graphical user interface, providing a seamless experience for users.

Functionality:
1. Topic Extraction with LDA:
   - The tool utilizes Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover potential topics within the input text data.
   - Users can adjust parameters, such as the number of topics or the maximum number of words per topic, to fine-tune the results.
   - The identified topics are presented to users, enabling a deeper understanding of the main themes in the text.

2. Text Summarization:
   - The summarization process relies on a combination of Regex functions and Tf-idf vectorizer.
   - Users receive a 35% summary of the original text, capturing the most relevant and informative content.
   - The summary is designed to be both concise and coherent, allowing users to grasp the key points quickly.

Graphical User Interface (GUI):
- The GUI is developed using Tkinter, a popular Python library for creating interactive interfaces.
- Users can easily input their text or upload a PDF file using the intuitive interface.
- The output is presented in a user-friendly format, displaying the potential topics and the 35% summary of the text.
- The GUI also offers options for adjusting LDA parameters to further explore different topic representations.

Conclusion:
This project provides a powerful and user-friendly tool for extracting potential topics and summarizing text data. By utilizing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and combining Regex functions with Tf-idf vectorization, users can quickly gain insights and grasp the main points of their text. The Tkinter-based GUI enhances the overall experience, making it accessible to users with various levels of technical expertise.

I continually update and improve this project, so your feedback and contributions are invaluable in refining its functionalities and performance. Feel free to explore the code and use the tool for your text analysis needs. Together, let's unlock the potential topics and uncover valuable insights hidden within text data!
